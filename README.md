## NOTICE!! It has stopped working as newsapi doesn't allow requests from browers other than localhost.


This project is built just to showcase a dark card's UI.

The news is fetched from https://newsapi.org/ with a limit of 500 requests per day. 

In the live version, my API Key is used :smile:


## Setting it up in local

#### Pre-requisites
  - Need to have Node >= 8
  - Go to https://newsapi.org/ and get a free API_KEY

#### Steps
  - Open `../src/Api.js` and add your API Key on Line 4.
  - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` being in the root directory.


## Contribution
